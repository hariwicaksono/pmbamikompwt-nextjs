This meant you could do things like preserve the scroll position in part of the UI that didn't change (like a sidebar for example) without the complexity of measuring it and trying to restore it on the next page load like you'd have to do in a traditional server-driven application.

Because this benefit was so heavily advertised, I was very surprised to find out that in many modern single-page application frameworks like Next.js and Gatsby, the default experience is re-rendering the entire UI every time you click a link â€” throwing away that nice feeling of a persistent UI we worked so hard to achieve a decade ago!

Next.js is such a wonderfully productive development experience and produces such incredibly fast websites that I just refused to believe it had to be this way.

So I spent a few weeks researching, asking questions, and experimenting, and came up with these four patterns for persistent layouts in Next.js applications.</span>
